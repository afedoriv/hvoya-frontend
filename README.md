## About The Project

### Overview

The **Hvoya Pottery Co. frontend** is a single-page application (SPA) developed using React, React Query and Redux Toolkit. It provides a high-performance, responsive, and accessible user experience. The application interacts with a custom RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js, which handles order creation, payment processing via Stripe, and order fulfillment. Supabase is utilized both on the frontend for real-time data management and user authentication, and on the backend for database management. The integration of Stripe ensures secure payment processing, offering users a seamless and reliable shopping experience across all devices.
